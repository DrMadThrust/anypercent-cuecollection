## Introduction
Cue and setup collections for each of the 7 levels in any%. Note that this follows current optimal route of 5b and 6b. This guide will be updated with 5a/6a in the distant future, but the focus currently is on finishing 5b/6b.
\
I assume that the reader already knows what hypers, demohypers, supers, cornerboosts, and other important mechanics are. If you are still getting started with running Celeste and speedrunning in general, I highly suggest joining the [Celeste discord](https://discord.com/invite/celeste) and taking a look at the speedrunning section. The pinned messages in #speedrun-general and #speedrun-help are great resources for new runners and are more beneficial than this visual cue collection.
\
**general note:** These arent necessarily the fastest strats, just cues and setups that aren't 100% consistent and what I use. I'll be open to add other cues once I've finished my part in creating a foundation for the guide. If you have any suggestions for cues, DM me at koralðŸ‘‘#0004 on discord and I'll be happy to talk. (please only DM after i've finished up to summit)

## Key Cycles
According to fishmcmuffins:

"For a key to enter the keyhole:

- One second (60f) must have passed since the key started moving towards the door
\
- The key must be facing the door (animation frame 4)

- The key spins slowly at all times until it's facing the door, when the speed triples. This means that for every three frames saved between entering a room with a key and putting the key in a door, one frame will be lost to the door.

- Best key opening time compared to worst key opening time is about .4

- General rule of thumb with a key you save 2 frames for every 3 frames you save unless you make a better cycle"

Even though I will assume that you know general game mechanics and terminology, I think these key cycles can help for people to understand how exactly to achieve the fast key cycles shown in this guide. (2 in resort start, 1 in 2500m)
## Formatting
This collection will be split up into different markdown files to avoid needing to load 50+ gifs at a time when checking this page. Each chapter will have its own table of contents and follow the format given below. 5A and 6A (Mirror Temple and Reflection) will have their tape segment + A-Side clear cues together, as the tape cues can be applied to the regular A-Side clear.
Attached below are some drawings of format of the guide, and you should read it as such.

## Credits
Thanks to czyys and buhbai for their github guides and being the inspiration to start my own collection of strats. (credit me discord + veru for proofreading, credit fishmcmuffins for key cycle explanation and most of the cues here. thanks for reading.)

   Neutral dashjump, hold right after jump input then buffer 2nd jump, should guarantee cornerboost every time.

   Wavedash and hold jump and the cornerboost should line up.

   \
   Do a min dashjump, pressing dash+jump at almost the same time around this point where the traffic block passed and you can get a clean landing pretty easily.

   \
  This is already covered in bubs guide, but buffer wallbounce on screen 1, demohyper bhop at the peak of your height and dash upright at this coffee shop corner.
   \

   \
   Make sure to wait a bit for the previous updiag speed to carry you up more, then updash.

   \
   The key here for this spring skip is to get an ultra that lands on this tile and jumping instantly. You'll know when you've gotten this with a different landing sound.
   After holding jump, down, and right through transition, you want to let go of jump after madeline has passed the spring, and demo to the other spring. The ultra here requires a certain feel but these cues should push you in the right direction.

   \
   Doing this upright dash right on this cue allows you to land on the far left on the crumble block and lets you get your dash back easily.
  </details>

   \
   This strat becomes manageable if you know what to look for. Neutral and hold jump off the circled corner, then upright dash + buffer neutral jump at any point past the line. Be sure to start holding left as soon as you see madeline cornerkick.

   \
   Downright dashing at this point allows you to gain your dash back while still breaking the block. Buffer a downleft here or do the bhop strat afterwards.
   </details>

   \
   Upleft dashing between these two blue lines guarantees Madeline's Y-position always being in the dream block after the cutscene skip.

   \
   After the extended hyper on the wood platform, do an upright dash asap and you should have enough height to do a transition wallbounce and get a faster exit.
   </details>

   \
   After upright dashing from the bottom of the dream block, grab the corner of the 2nd dream block and climb up to the ceiling. At this point, you should be able to upleft dash    cleanly through the dream block and skip the long way around.
   </details>

   \
   This neutral cornerkick is extremely feel based and hard to get down at first, but this cue might help for getting muscle memory on the right track. It also helps to get to the left side of the coin block ASAP as its activating.
   </details>

   \
   Stand on the coin, extend your hyper as much as possible, hold jump and down and right. You should only need to adjust for the 3rd coin with this.
   </details>

   \
   This is the correct height needed to get the downright cb, noted by Madeline lining up with the pink space pixels. If you aren't lined up, back this up with an upright dash to get to the platform. You will die or lose more time otherwise.

   \
   For this fast key setup, dash down asap after grabbing the key and hyper cb off the stair ledge. For the cb off the crates, hug the key door and grounded ultra into the next room. Buffer the jump from the grounded ultra and hold jump as you do the cb. downright dash after clearing the towels.

   You want to enter 02-a with a crouched bhop to make the demohyper > diag strat more lenient. Bhop at or after the smoke from this vent.

   Do two min neutral jumps then after the demohyper, wait a bit until Madeline's body is halfway matched to this ceiling, then buffer both dashes.

   \
   The upleft wallkick helps to ensure you don't go too fast, and downleft dashing on this cue and only holding left allows you drift into the key. After landing, do a neutral walljump into a downleft > down > downright dash.
   \

   \
   This climb is really tricky at first, but gets easier with muscle memory. **It is important that you hold left the whole time during this climb.** Enter without a crouched hitbox (demohyper bhop or right dash into spring), then tap both jump buttons and tap jump again when Madeline reaches the corner. Make sure to not hold right early otherwise you wont get the third jump off the corner.

   Weirdly specific cutscene trigger for this skip, pause while performing a grounded ultra on this cue and you should have the best speed leaving this cutscene. The setup used in the gif enters the room with a max height bhop, then at the peak performs two quick wavedashes.

   This strat is a bit dumb but there are good cues. Downleft dash after max height hyper bhop and upright dash between the two lines highlighted. If you need another cue for learning, the end of the window is a good place to look for timing the downleft.

   After a neutral wallbounce, buffer two dashes right after jump and hyper bhop. You need to get a coyote jump off the super in order to get the two fast cbs.

   When leaving 10-c, be sure to hold jump and buffer a downright dash to get a bhop and dodge the dust bunnies. To make the fast cycle in 12-d, wallbounce in the previous room pictured before entering to gain more height. The fast cycle is more managable with this extra boost.

   You need to line up Madeline to the platforms before performing an extended super and a demohyper respectively. After the super, line yourself up then do an extended demohyper into a buffered upright dash. Hold jump and cb with 2nd jump button. During transition, let go of jump and cb after transition.

   On entrance, do a wavedash and get 3 climbjumps to make the wind cycle and get to the bubble. Buffer both the bubble upleft and the updash and drift into the wall and climbjump. If you buffered both bubble dashes, you shouldn't ever die to the spikes before the 2nd bubble.

   Start a hyper in the previous room, buffer jump, right dash after this flower on the ground, and hyper bhop. Don't shorten the hyper bhop too much otherwise you die. This cue also works for the grounded ultra, just do a hyper bhop from previous screen and min jump.
